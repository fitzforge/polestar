-- Chinese (traditional) (zhTW): the guide forever/collectibles/pets/shadowgale-squirrel (forever/collectibles/pets/shadowgale-squirrel.guide).
-- Written by `forge i18n guides sync zhTW`, which keeps every translation (docs/TRANSLATING.md, "Guide texts").
-- Translate the right-hand sides; "" shows the English. Keep each {kind:id} as it is: the game shows its
-- name there in Chinese (traditional) (the English is listed above the line). A name the English has in the plural, as words,
-- may be written with the singular's token from its "plural, as words" line: "Bandidos ({npc:251918})", "{npc:251918} ×8".
-- A token marked "no name in this language" would show in English: write that name in Chinese (traditional) words instead.
